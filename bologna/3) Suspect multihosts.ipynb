    "### I'm going to do that exploiting textual descriptions of the announces (\"description\", \"space\" and \"summary\" columns above all) into an Inside Airbnb dataset (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html by Murray Cox). The reason is that a lot of announces seem to have very similar description although they belong to different hosts. That means that apparently there's a copy-paste abuse among hosts that MAYBE belong to the same home structure. Why one should ever do that? Why a big Airbnb commercial player is pushed to create different \"host\" entities to handle his property? Look at that:"

As you can see, around the 50% of them has a definitely \"human\" and \"italian\" name, in spite of their commercial vocation. Agostino, Franco, Silvia... They inspire confidence, intimacy, autenticity. Isn't strange? Would you let your uncle Mario represent your italian guesthouse in full? Apparently, you should! Multihosts and commercial partners are a problem for Airbnb storytelling because they're faceless, and they're not consistent with the idea of a resident host, keen to show and explain his/her exotic city to guests. That's perhaps why the host identity tends to be humanized and parcellized on the platform.\n",
